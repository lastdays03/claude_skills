# Knowledge Refiner Standards

## Purpose
To move notes from "Transient" to "Permanent" status by adding structure, depth, and connectivity.

## The Gold Standard (Quality Gate)
1.  **Definitions**: Must be clear and jargon-free (ELI5 if needed).
2.  **Examples**: Concrete code snippets or real-world use cases are mandatory.
3.  **Comparisons**: contrast with similar concepts (e.g., `Thread` vs `Process`).
4.  **Insights**: Must conclude with "Key Takeaways" or "Pattern recognition".

## Refinement Modes
- **Standardize**: Apply `concept-template.md`.
- **Elaborate**: Add depth to weak sections.
- **Link**: Auto-link to existing concepts in `20_Learning`.
- **Multimodal**: Add Mermaid diagrams or Tables.
